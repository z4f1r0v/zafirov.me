      <description>As a person doing a primarily sitting type of job I am sure you will relate to some of the following health issues:
 eye strain lower back pain wrist pain headaches reduced mobility trouble falling asleep etc.  Depending on which part of the world you live in, office working conditions may or may not be viewed as a contributor to these things. I am lucky to be part of a society where these things matter and people are conscientious about their health.</description>

      <description>If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the concept of being (in the) present, let me quickly bring you up to speed. We lead our daily lives stormed by visual stimuli. They bombard us at every step from the moment we go out into the real or the digital world. That is slowly starting to wear people down. The reason is that from an evolutionary standpoint the increased amount of visual signals make us more alert and push us in fight-or-flight mode.</description>
