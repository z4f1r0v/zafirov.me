      <description>This year I decided that instead of making my regular 3 hours plane trip towards home for Christmas, I will instead join some friends for a road trip through the old continent. I did that with the clear understanding it will take 3 days - of which the majority would be spent into the confined space of a car. Yes, it does seem counter-intuitive since:
 it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get you from point A to point B that fast it&amp;rsquo;s holiday season there are many cars on the highways the weather conditions can be difficult to drive in etc.</description>

      <description>I recently visited the Rajasthan state in India and, boy, was it a memorable experience. In this post Iâ€™d like to share my experiences and hopefully help out somebody that is planning a trip to this funky place.
The reason for which I headed to India in the first place was that my girlfriend was invited to a wedding. Honestly I had no idea of what to expect. After some google-ing I found out that Indian weddings last for days and are a sight to see.</description>
