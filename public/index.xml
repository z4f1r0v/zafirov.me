      <description>Ever since its public release in 2004, Scala has been challenging the traditional development strategies. Due to its mix of object-oriented (OO) and functional programming (FP), the language has received a fair amount of criticism regarding being complex, unopinionated and slow to develop. Fast-forward to more recent times, I stumbled upon this post. In it the author mentions many valid criticisms towards Scala as an overall experience. Furthermore, he gives recommendations as to where Scala&amp;rsquo;s strength resides.</description>

      <description>In the last days of 2020, I cannot help but contemplate over the past year. And what a year it has been. To my family and friends I say that this was the toughest year I ever had in my lifetime. Many would agree regardless if they know me or not. Covid-19 has changed everything we know about our day-to-day. It has had repercussions on my life as well, yet I&amp;rsquo;m sure they aren&amp;rsquo;t as severe as for others.</description>

      <description>During my career as a software developer I have had many colleagues in the engineering department that had the word &amp;ldquo;senior&amp;rdquo; as part of their job title. Others used fancier alternatives such as &amp;ldquo;specialist&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;expert&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo;. Those people were quite different among themselves in their knowledge, technical skills and attitude towards teammates to name a few. Having interacted with them for prolonged durations at a time, I realized that it is not straightforward to give a precise definition as to what makes up a &amp;ldquo;senior software engineer&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Core traits of a skilled software engineer</title>

      <description>Making software in this day and age seems like a trivial task. There are cloud providers - Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Azure - open-source languages, tools and frameworks, and many sources like blogs/podcasts/YouTube channels where experienced engineers share their success and failure. Thus, theoretically it should not be hard to learn a tool, write some code and solve a problem that exists in the world.
I personally agree and disagree with this statement.</description>

      <description>For many years my closest friends inspired and humbled me by demonstrating how true determination and hard work can alter the perception one calls life. Luckily this power - I really do consider it an ability to be mastered or unlocked - is not bound to a selected few. That comes to say that each of us is capable of dreaming something - big or small - and pursuing it.</description>

      <description>Developers, software engineers, coders. Many names that in all honesty refer to the same persona. What do these people do all day? Why are they in such high demand? Why do they get such high salaries? Why don&amp;rsquo;t they conform to the norms that people laid out for many years as far as clothing, procedures, communication skills go? I will attempt to answer these and other questions in this post.</description>

      <description>This year I decided that instead of making my regular 3 hours plane trip towards home for Christmas, I will instead join some friends for a road trip through the old continent. I did that with the clear understanding it will take 3 days - of which the majority would be spent into the confined space of a car. Yes, it does seem counter-intuitive since:
 it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get you from point A to point B that fast it&amp;rsquo;s holiday season there are many cars on the highways the weather conditions can be difficult to drive in etc.</description>

      <description>When we make decisions about our career we can never be absolutely sure whether they will play out the way we expect them. Having switched my job several times with an average stay at a position of 2 years, I can easily say that job switching has allowed me to be excited about work, meet new people, see different points of view and continuously learn. Along the way I have tried to gather as much knowledge applicable to any domain that I&amp;rsquo;m crafting software for.</description>

      <description>As a person doing a primarily sitting type of job I am sure you will relate to some of the following health issues:
 eye strain lower back pain wrist pain headaches reduced mobility trouble falling asleep etc.  Depending on which part of the world you live in, office working conditions may or may not be viewed as a contributor to these things. I am lucky to be part of a society where these things matter and people are conscientious about their health.</description>

      <title>Staying present</title>

      <description>If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with the concept of being (in the) present, let me quickly bring you up to speed. We lead our daily lives stormed by visual stimuli. They bombard us at every step from the moment we go out into the real or the digital world. That is slowly starting to wear people down. The reason is that from an evolutionary standpoint the increased amount of visual signals make us more alert and push us in fight-or-flight mode.</description>

      <description>Before I write this I want to assure you that this is no plead for attention. For anyone that has been a part of my contacts on the aforementioned social network - you would know that I am mainly reposting articles that I read. So in a sense I use FB as another way to store articles.
The other day I was talking to a friend, and he said &amp;ldquo;Man, I&amp;rsquo;m going to leave this shit one day soon&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Today is a great day! But why is that? To answer that question first let me walk you through my year.
As is obvious I haven&amp;rsquo;t written much in 2017 and that is for a reason. I traveled, I faced obstacles and learned a lot of lessons from my mistakes. If 2016 was a year of changes then 2017 was that and some more, so I name the last 12 months - a year of challenges.</description>

      <description>2016 was a rough year. Everywhere you look you see turmoil. Brexit, Trump, Syria, Nice, Berlin, Migrants, &amp;hellip; And here comes a question - has this world been in a tougher spot? Of course. And we have always persevered. How? By being human!
I will come back to this thought but first let me take you through my 2016. It was also full of highs and lows. Fortunately for me, it peaked in mainly positive outcomes.</description>

      <description>In the spirit of the Christmas and New Year&amp;rsquo;s festivities, I decided to share with you a short and fun recursive function that can warm your hearts. If not - hopefully it will warm your gray matter a bit.
import scala.annotation.tailrec def xmasTree(height: Int): Unit = { @tailrec def xmasTree(n: Int, t: Int): Unit = { if (n == t) { println(&amp;#34; &amp;#34; * (t - n) + &amp;#34;*&amp;#34; * (1 + n * 2)) println(if (n == 1) &amp;#34; # &amp;#34; else if (n == 2) &amp;#34; # &amp;#34; else List.</description>

      <title>Working with nulls in Spark UDFs</title>

      <description>Sometimes the simplest things are hardest to work out. Let&amp;rsquo;s say I have a DataFrame created from a parquet file which can have nullable columns that are of a certain type - in this example that is Int. The reason I chose Int particularly is that it is not a trivial case i.e. it doesn&amp;rsquo;t accept nulls as values. The problem that arises is that the DataFrame can have IntegerType specified for the schema and still contain nulls.</description>

      <description>I have enjoyed physical activity from a very early age. Since I was blessed with being a child of the pre-computer era I spent my free time outside on the street, playing with my peers. I clearly remember the endless summer days when I was chasing a football with my legs covered in black and blue spots from all the falls they had to bear. While competing against other players I came to know what it means to win and lose.</description>

      <description>I recently visited the Rajasthan state in India and, boy, was it a memorable experience. In this post I’d like to share my experiences and hopefully help out somebody that is planning a trip to this funky place.
The reason for which I headed to India in the first place was that my girlfriend was invited to a wedding. Honestly I had no idea of what to expect. After some google-ing I found out that Indian weddings last for days and are a sight to see.</description>

      <description>I guess it has been some years now. Unlike many of my peers I believe I have started thinking about “life” from an early age. It was for some long forgotten reason that I realized around the age of 12 that I am going to die one day. Such a terrible thought to think. Especially by a child. Every time it came across my mind there were two outcomes. In one case I just quickly rejected the thought and tossed it aside, continuing my previous work.</description>

      <description>Music is a very powerful tool. It is the universal language that communicates to all people no matter of their race or beliefs. It provokes the mind and soul, and sets the imagination free. From a musician’s perspective, music is also an away to express yourself on a higher level. Depending on the mindset of a certain musician having no rules in music can be the biggest freedom or the hardest constraint.</description>

      <description>Leaving the country that you were born in is difficult. The older you are, the more difficult it gets. I made the decision at a stage of my life when it was in place. High education degree, decent job, nice apartment, plenty of hobbies and social contacts. Most importantly I had the loving family, friends and soul mate that every person needs.
I already had what an average person seeks/wants/gets in the best case.</description>
