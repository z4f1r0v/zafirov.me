<h1 id="assume-the-other-persons-perspective">Assume the other person&rsquo;s perspective</h1>
<p>In a debate, disagreement or simple conversation it is often the case that one assumes a given point of view. That is quite normal. A difficult but extremely beneficial skill is to possess the capacity to argue from more than one perspectives. It allows for the owner to of the initial point of view to verify its worth and helps remove emotional barriers that come up in a given discussion between two parties.</p>
<p>It is common knowledge that in a debate of sorts, it is the opinion under discussion that is important and not the person that defends it. That is easier said than done. In the heat of the moment, it takes composure and mental strength to focus on the matter at hand while keeping feelings at bay.</p>
<p>Whenever I succeeded catching myself being overly protective of my standpoint, I tried to quickly relax and refocus. That allowed me to see that my sparring partner was equally curious and excited to get to the essence of the problem.</p>
