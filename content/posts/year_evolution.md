Another revolution of our dear planet around the Sun is coming to a close. This serves as a reminder for me to reflect 
on all that has happened. It also gives me time to think about my high-level goals for the upcoming roundtrip.

# Employment
## New responsibilities
2021 found me starting a new employment. Naturally, that was a cause for excitement.
As with every new chapter in my career, I was curious, excited and - as I would realize by the end of the year - 
ill-prepared for what's to come. I found that my new role required new set of skills from me. 
Ultimately, I needed to transition from being a software engineer and individual contributor, 
to a mix of software engineer, strategy and alignment and people management.

The transition happened very organically, so I didn't recognize it as ongoing until it was well underway.
There were many questions that I struggled with:
- Why am I not coding this when I know how to solve this problem in a minute?
- Am I a fraud for doing a PowerPoint slide on something that my colleague has worked on?
- Do I have a good grasp of what is happening technology-wise when I am not coding as much as I used to?
- Is it ok to have my colleagues build software for me without my code contributions?

This seems to be a natural transition for someone coming from a software engineering background given a more strategic 
set of responsibilities.
