Leaving the country that you were born in is difficult. The older you are, the more difficult it gets. 
I made the decision at a stage of my life when it was in place. 
High education degree, decent job, nice apartment, plenty of hobbies and social contacts. 
Most importantly I had the loving family, friends and soul mate that every person needs.

I already had what an average person seeks/wants/gets in the best case. 
And then came the fork in the road - should I pursue an even higher degree or was I happy with what I had? 
Of course, the choice was much more complicated - especially for a man who wants to predict all possible outcomes 
and weight in all the paths so that the right choice is made. 
I wasn't alone in this - everyone supported me, and I felt that slowly but surely the choice is turning into a decision.

I will never be able to explain the mixed feelings that I was experiencing as the day of my departure was drawing near. 
Sadness for the loss that I am having in the face of my loved ones, excitement towards the unknown, 
joy for all the dreams that could (would) come to fruition, fear of failing miserably, ... 
One thing was certain I was going to study abroad, and I was doing it because I wanted. 
A conscious decision provoked by something that would later on reveal itself to be my main characteristic.

I am not religious, but I do believe that chance, coincidence or karma are the words that come closest to what 
I can describe as “something funny” about life. 
That “funny” made things happen so that I got a total stranger to join me on my adventure to the unknown 
because he shared my main intention - to get real knowledge and become better. 
I am happy to say that this person is one of most warm-hearted, fun-loving and generous people I know. 
I am proud to call him my friend!

I remember the first night I arrived at my new home. The feeling you get when you close the door of your room, 
and you are finally alone after a day full of airports, luggage and public transportation. 
The moment when you lay your head on the pillow, you snuggle in the bedsheets and close your eyes. 
The moment when you realize that you are not on a holiday. That your belongings all fit in the suitcase in the corner. 
The moment when you realize that your family is not at a “hands reach” but thousands of kilometers away. 
Sure, there is Skype but what is a distorted image to a warm smile, a kiss or a long hug?

It is safe to say that my heart, my friends and family have led me to where I feel is best for me. 
I have gone through some tough times in my recent years living away from home, 
but I am happy to say that I have started to build one on my own. From the ground. With my two hands. 
It didn't happen overnight. 
It was a process that involved answering for your own actions, taking care of the way you look, behave and work, 
accessing yourself constantly, competing with the ones better than you, etc. 
It wasn't always pretty, but it was (and still is) worth it.
