Sometimes the simplest things are hardest to work out. Let's say I have a `DataFrame` created from a parquet file which can have nullable columns that are of a certain type - in this example that is `Int`. The reason I chose `Int` particularly is that it is _not a trivial_ case i.e. it doesn't accept `null`s as values. The problem that arises is that the `DataFrame` can have `IntegerType` specified for the schema and still contain `null`s. I need to think of something that reflects the fact that I'm getting `Int` and `null` in the same type or else I will get a runtime exception for wrong input type. Tackling this is the goal of this post. On a side note - `String` is _trivial_ since it works with nulls - no need for magic there.

The first solution to the problem is hideous. I don't like it but it works. I know that the following could be done with an implicit, but I don't like them since they are hard to trace in a bigger code base.

The first step is to  set the input of the UDF to be `Any`.
```scala
def foo: (Any => Int) = (a: Any) => toInt(a) / 100000

val toFoo = udf(foo)
```

After that the most important thing happens in the `toInt` function. Since I have a val of type `Any` that may contain a `null`, I wrap that in an `Option`. After that I proceed to set a default value. Since I'm specifying Int and Any as types, the compiler will try and resolve the first common type in the type tree - that is `Any` - I need to cast the result to `Int`.

```scala
def toInt(v: Any): Int = Option(v).getOrElse(0).asInstanceOf[Int]
```

```scala
val outDf = dfParquet
    .withColumn("foo_column", toFoo('a))
    .select("a","b","foo_column")
    .show()
```

Phew! As I said this is not bullet-proof. The reason is that I use `Any`, I've opened the door to all types so if I pass a String, let's say, the `asInstanceOf` will fail during execution.

Luckily the solution is quite simple. Just use Java's `Integer` boxed primitive. It is a perfect candidate for the case. This means no conversions from `Any`, no opening of Pandora's Any box. If you need to make better sense of the `null` value you can leverage on the `Option` class.

```scala
def foo: (Integer => Option[Integer]) = (i: Integer) => Option(i).map(_ + 1)
```
