      <description>As we are approaching the end of another circle our planet will complete around the Sun, I cannot help but join the rest of the humans inhabiting our &amp;ldquo;pale blue dot&amp;rdquo; in recapping what has happened in the past 365 days, how that compared to my plans and what I should hope to achieve in the next available slot.&#xA;If I were to give a TL;DR description of this year, I would say it was a year of (re)definition.</description>

      <description>This is my story of 2022. The story of how in the span of two weeks, I went from the best version of myself to someone I barely recognized. That and the experiences following. This story has been unfolding since the beginning of the year. It still is. I feel that I&amp;rsquo;m ready to talk about it now. Primarily, because I have achieved some milestones I set for myself. Also, because enough time has passed to put this journey in the long haul category.</description>

      <description>In the last days of 2020, I cannot help but contemplate over the past year. And what a year it has been. To my family and friends I say that this was the toughest year I ever had in my lifetime. Many would agree regardless if they know me or not. Covid-19 has changed everything we know about our day-to-day. It has had repercussions on my life as well, yet I&amp;rsquo;m sure they aren&amp;rsquo;t as severe as for others.</description>

      <description>For many years my closest friends inspired and humbled me by demonstrating how true determination and hard work can alter the perception one calls life. Luckily this power - I really do consider it an ability to be mastered or unlocked - is not bound to a selected few. That comes to say that each of us is capable of dreaming something - big or small - and pursuing it.</description>

      <description>When we make decisions about our career we can never be absolutely sure whether they will play out the way we expect them. Having switched my job several times with an average stay at a position of 2 years, I can easily say that job switching has allowed me to be excited about work, meet new people, see different points of view and continuously learn. Along the way I have tried to gather as much knowledge applicable to any domain that I&amp;rsquo;m crafting software for.</description>

      <title>Goodbye cruel Facebook world</title>

      <description>Before I write this I want to assure you that this is no plead for attention. For anyone that has been a part of my contacts on the aforementioned social network - you would know that I am mainly reposting articles that I read. So in a sense I use FB as another way to store articles.&#xA;The other day I was talking to a friend, and he said &amp;ldquo;Man, I&amp;rsquo;m going to leave this shit one day soon&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Today is a great day! But why is that? To answer that question first let me walk you through my year.&#xA;As is obvious I haven&amp;rsquo;t written much in 2017 and that is for a reason. I traveled, I faced obstacles and learned a lot of lessons from my mistakes. If 2016 was a year of changes then 2017 was that and some more, so I name the last 12 months - a year of challenges.</description>

      <description>2016 was a rough year. Everywhere you look you see turmoil. Brexit, Trump, Syria, Nice, Berlin, Migrants, &amp;hellip; And here comes a question - has this world been in a tougher spot? Of course. And we have always persevered. How? By being human!&#xA;I will come back to this thought but first let me take you through my 2016. It was also full of highs and lows. Fortunately for me, it peaked in mainly positive outcomes.</description>

      <description>I have enjoyed physical activity from a very early age. Since I was blessed with being a child of the pre-computer era I spent my free time outside on the street, playing with my peers. I clearly remember the endless summer days when I was chasing a football with my legs covered in black and blue spots from all the falls they had to bear. While competing against other players I came to know what it means to win and lose.</description>

      <description>I guess it has been some years now. Unlike many of my peers I believe I have started thinking about “life” from an early age. It was for some long forgotten reason that I realized around the age of 12 that I am going to die one day. Such a terrible thought to think. Especially by a child. Every time it came across my mind there were two outcomes. In one case I just quickly rejected the thought and tossed it aside, continuing my previous work.</description>

      <description>Music is a very powerful tool. It is the universal language that communicates to all people no matter of their race or beliefs. It provokes the mind and soul, and sets the imagination free. From a musician’s perspective, music is also an away to express yourself on a higher level. Depending on the mindset of a certain musician having no rules in music can be the biggest freedom or the hardest constraint.</description>

      <description>Leaving the country that you were born in is difficult. The older you are, the more difficult it gets. I made the decision at a stage of my life when it was in place. High education degree, decent job, nice apartment, plenty of hobbies and social contacts. Most importantly I had the loving family, friends and soul mate that every person needs.&#xA;I already had what an average person seeks/wants/gets in the best case.</description>
